# YouTube Clone React Project

This README file outlines a feature-rich YouTube clone project built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and various essential libraries. It leverages the Rapid API YouTube v3 API to provide a seamless YouTube-like experience.

Key Features:

- Advanced Search: Effortlessly find videos using a search bar that mirrors YouTube's functionality.
- Channel Pages: Explore dedicated pages for channels, showcasing their uploaded videos.
- Video Playbacks: Enjoy smooth video playback with basic controls (play, pause, volume).
- Comments Section: Engage with other viewers by leaving comments (requires API integration with YouTube's Comment Threads API).
- Suggested Videos: Discover new content based on your watch history (requires advanced API integration and data processing).
- Dark/Light Themes: Personalize your viewing experience by switching between light and dark themes.
- Category Browsing: Navigate through video categories (requires implementing API endpoints for retrieving category-specific videos).
  
Technologies:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with pre-built classes.
- react-player: A lightweight component for embedding videos from various sources.
- react-icons: A collection of SVG icons for common UI elements.
- react-router-dom: A library for handling routing within React applications.
- moment.js: (Optional) A library for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates and times (potentially useful for displaying video upload dates or comment timestamps).
- Rapid API YouTube v3 API: Provides access to YouTube data for searching, retrieving video information, and more (https://rapidapi.com/ytdlfree/api/youtube-v31).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
